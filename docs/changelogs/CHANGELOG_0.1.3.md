## [0.1.3] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- `src/angular_meta/graph.rs` — New `AngularGraphBuilder` type (F-ANG-05, Track B): the mutable builder holds `register_class` and `build(self)` consumes it, returning an immutable `AngularGraph` with no public `register_class`/`resolve_all` methods. `AngularGraph::new()` removed from public API; the only construction path is `AngularGraphBuilder::build()`.
- 2 new typestate tests: `builder_consumes_self` (documents the compile-time guarantee) and `resolved_flag_always_true_for_builder_output` (replaces the old `!is_resolved()` check that was only possible on the now-removed `AngularGraph::new()`)

### Changed
- `GraphCollector::build_graph` now drives `AngularGraphBuilder` internally instead of calling `AngularGraph::register_class` / `resolve_all` directly
- `AngularGraph::all_classes` now returns entries in insertion order (no longer sorts by `class_name`) — matches the doc-comment and reduces allocation

### Test count
- 293/293 tests pass (2 new from Track B)
- 0 clippy warnings (`cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`)
